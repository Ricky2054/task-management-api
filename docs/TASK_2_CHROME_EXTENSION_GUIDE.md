   - Try the "Users" section
   - Navigate through different pages
   ```

3. **Interact with Website 2** (e.g., FakeStore API)
   ```bash
   # Visit the demo page or build a simple frontend
   https://fakestoreapi.com/
   
   # Perform actions like:
   - Browse products
   - View product details
   - Add items to cart (if demo available)
   - Filter by categories
   ```

4. **Stop Recording**

# From Zero to Hero: How AI Transformed My API Testing Game

As a developer, I've always dreaded writing API tests. The repetitive nature, the constant maintenance, and the nagging feeling that I'm missing edge cases made testing feel more like a chore than a crucial part of development.

That all changed when I discovered the Keploy Chrome Extension.

In this post, I'll share my journey from spending hours writing manual tests to generating comprehensive test suites in minutes using AI. Spoiler alert: it's a game-changer.

## The Old Way: Manual Testing Blues

Before Keploy, my API testing workflow looked like this:
- Identify endpoints to test ‚è∞ 30 minutes
- Write test cases manually ‚è∞ 2-3 hours
- Create mock data ‚è∞ 1 hour
- Debug failing tests ‚è∞ 1-2 hours
- Maintain tests as APIs evolve ‚è∞ Ongoing headache

**Total time per API**: 4-6 hours minimum

## The New Way: AI-Powered Magic

With Keploy Chrome Extension:
- Install extension ‚è∞ 2 minutes
- Record API interactions ‚è∞ 5 minutes
- Generate tests with AI ‚è∞ 3 minutes
- Review and customize ‚è∞ 10 minutes

**Total time per API**: 20 minutes maximum

Let me show you exactly how this works...
```

## üì± Step 5: Social Media Content

üéØ The Future of API Testing is Here

I just spent the afternoon testing the Keploy Chrome Extension, and it's completely changed how I think about API testing.

**What I discovered:**

‚Üí Manual test writing: 4-6 hours per API
‚Üí AI-generated tests: 20 minutes per API
‚Üí Coverage: From 40% to 100% automatically
‚Üí Maintenance: Drastically reduced

**My Process:**
1. Installed the Chrome extension (2 mins)
2. Browsed websites with APIs 
3. Extension captured all API calls automatically
4. AI generated comprehensive test suites
5. Deployed tests to CI/CD pipeline

**The Results:**
‚úÖ Tested JSONPlaceholder API: 15 endpoints covered
‚úÖ Tested FakeStore API: Complete e-commerce flow
‚úÖ Generated 50+ test cases automatically
‚úÖ Found edge cases I would have missed

This isn't just about speed‚Äîit's about quality. The AI identifies patterns and edge cases that human testers often miss.

**For fellow developers:** If you're still writing API tests manually, you need to try this. The time savings alone are worth it, but the improved coverage and quality are the real game-changers.
